   <h3>
       Hello my name is Yasser I am originally from Yemen, moved to San Diego for college in 2010 and decided to continue my life here. 
       I'm a Business graduate, currently in a software development program at MIT working to move into a career in full stack development and software engineering. 
       Regardless to how busy life gets I always make the time to get a nice workout in and have a quality time with friends and family.
